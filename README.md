**Literature Review**

**Introduction**

The interplay between smartphone usage and academic

performance has garnered significant attention in recent years.

Prasad et al. (2017) in their study "Nomophobia: A Cross-

sectional Study to Assess Mobile Phone Usage Among Dental

Students" highlight a direct negative impact of mobile phone

usage on the academic performance of dental students, with a

substantial portion acknowledging lower exam scores due to

excessive phone usage. This aligns with the broader discourse

on smartphones as a distraction in academic settings.

In this age of digital proliferation, the intricate relationship

between technology and education is more complex than ever.

Smartphones, integral to students' lives, pose unique challenges

and opportunities in learning environments. "Uncovering the

Truth: A Study on Students’ Studying Habits" delves into this

relationship, particularly focusing on the impact of smartphone

usage on students' academic habits. Building on existing

research that suggests a negative correlation between mobile

phone usage and academic performance, our study employs a

nuanced approach. By leveraging data from the weNet

experiment, where students' smartphone interactions and self-

reported study activities were meticulously tracked, we aim to

analyze real-time patterns of smartphone usage. This includes an

in-depth examination of app usage and touch frequency during

claimed study periods. Our research endeavors to unravel how

smartphones affect students' focus and the degree to which these

devices are used for educational versus non-educational

purposes, offering a detailed perspective on the dynamic

between digital technology and student productivity.

Zogheib and Daniela (2021) explored this further in "Students’

Perception of Cell Phones Effect on their Academic

Performance: A Latvian and a Middle Eastern University

Cases." Their findings suggest that while smartphone usage is a

significant academic distraction, its impact varies across

different academic activities. It was less of a distraction during

quizzes, exams, group studies, or in-class activities, and did not

promote academic dishonesty.

Ezemenaka (2013), in "The Usage and Impact of Internet

Enabled Phones on Academic Concentration among Students of

Tertiary Institutions: A Study at the University of Ibadan,

Nigeria," presents a nuanced view. While acknowledging the

distraction caused by internet-enabled phones, the study did not

find a definitive link to diminished academic performance

among students at the University of Ibadan.

**Methodology**

In this study, we employed a comprehensive methodology

utilizing the data from the weNet experiment conducted in 2020

by the University of Trento. Participants in the study were

prompted every 30 minutes to report their current activity,

enabling a correlation between self-reported data and objective

sensor data from their smartphones. This included meticulous

tracking of touchscreen interactions and app usage. Our focus

was primarily on the initial two-week period of data collection,

which provided a rich dataset for analysis and a total number of

138 valid user. We define valid user, each student that responded

at least at 80% of the notifications, had no issues regarding its

smartphone touch sensor and studied at least one time during the

two weeks period. Our analysis aimed at discerning the

authenticity of the students' claim of studying by scrutinizing the

touch frequency and the nature of the apps used during these

self-reported study times.

Lastly, Thornton et al. (2014), in "The Mere Presence of a Cell

Phone May be Distracting," provide evidence that even the mere

presence of a cell phone can reduce attention and impair task

performance, particularly for tasks demanding higher cognitive

and attentional resources.

These studies collectively underscore the complex relationship

between smartphone usage and academic performance,

highlighting the need for deeper understanding and contextual

considerations in this dynamic interplay.

**Analysis of Touch Interactions Among Users**

The dataset was analyzed to discern patterns of smartphone

usage by quantifying touch interactions across different user

clusters. Two distinct temporal contexts were considered: 'While

Studying' and 'While Not Studying.' The normalized number of

touches per half-hour interval served as the primary metric for

this analysis.

The data was subjected to rigorous statistical analysis to

understand patterns in smartphone usage, particularly focusing

on the variance between reported study periods and observable

phone interactions. This allowed us to explore the depth of

distraction caused by smartphones. We took careful measures to

ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data, including

validation checks and cross-referencing sensor data with self-

***Cluster-Based Distribution During Study Period***

For the non-study period, the scatter plot indicates a similar

pattern of distribution across clusters. However, there is a

noticeable shift in the density of points for Cluster 0, which

appears to have more users with higher touch interactions

compared to the study period. Clusters 1 and 2 also display

increased touch interactions, with Cluster 2 maintaining its

position as the cluster with the highest touch interaction levels.

The scatter plot for the study period reveals a distribution of

touch interactions across three user clusters. Cluster 0 (cyan)

represents the group with the least normalized touch

interactions, clustering close to zero and rarely exceeding the

normalized value of 1. Cluster 1 (purple) shows moderate touch

interaction levels, with most data points lying between

normalized values of 0 to 2. Cluster 2 (yellow) includes users

with the highest levels of touch interactions, often surpassing a

normalized value of 2, suggesting significant smartphone usage

during study times.

The box plot for the non-study period corroborates these

observations. Cluster 0 shows a slight upward shift in median

touch interactions, yet maintains a narrow interquartile range.

Cluster 1 has a median value higher than that of the study

period, with a wide interquartile range that includes several

outliers. Cluster 2's box plot is characterized by a high median

and a substantial spread, suggesting diverse behavior among

users with high touch interactions.

By comparing the touch interactions across study and non-study

periods, it is evident, as expectable, that there is an overall

increase in smartphone usage outside study times. This is

particularly noticeable in Cluster 2, where users consistently

exhibit higher touch interactions. The presence of outliers in

both periods for Clusters 1 and 2 indicates that while the

majority of users within these clusters have moderate to high

touch interactions, a subset of users exhibit extremely high

smartphone engagement.

The analysis suggests that smartphone usage, as measured by

touch interactions, varies significantly across clusters and

between study and non-study periods. Users categorized in

Cluster 2 are more inclined to engage with their smartphones,

regardless of the context, while users in Cluster 0 are the least

engaged.

The corresponding box plot for the study period further

elucidates the distribution within each cluster. Cluster 0 exhibits

a compact interquartile range, indicating homogeneity in low

touch interactions among its users. Cluster 1 displays a broader

interquartile range with more variability in touch interactions.

Cluster 2, while having a similar interquartile range to Cluster 1,

is significantly higher on the touch interaction scale, including

some outliers indicating exceptionally high usage.

**Analysis of App Usage and Cluster Transition Patterns**

**Among Users**

This section forms part of a broader examination of user

behavior in digital environments. It specifically focuses on app

usage patterns within distinct user clusters and their transitions

between these clusters during study and non-study periods.

These insights are integral to understanding the fluidity of

digital engagement in varied contexts.

*Cluster-Based Distribution During Non-Study Period*

***App usage patterns during study period***

A substantial number of users transitioned from Cluster 0 during

the study period to Cluster 1 in the non-study period, indicating

a shift from a balanced usage of communication and

entertainment apps to a more social and media-focused

engagement.

Clusters 1 and 2 showed stability, with users largely remaining

within these clusters, suggesting consistent app usage

preferences regardless of the period.

Cluster 3 exhibited notable fluidity, with users transitioning to

various clusters, reflecting a diverse range of changing interests

and activities outside the study period.

**Conclusions**

Given the data and analysis conducted on app usage patterns and

cluster transitions among users during study and non-study

periods, we can infer some insights regarding whether students

are using their smartphones for study-related activities or not.

However, it's important to note that the data primarily indicates

app usage patterns and doesn't directly measure the intent or

claim of the users (i.e., whether they claim to be studying or

not).

During the study period, significant usage was observed in

categories like Chat, Social, Media, and Productivity. While

Productivity apps might be aligned with studying, the high

usage of Chat, Social, and Media apps suggests that students

might also be engaging in activities not directly related to

studying.

Certain clusters showed consistent patterns of app usage

between study and non-study periods. For instance, a cluster

with high usage of Health & Fitness apps remained consistent,

indicating that users’ behavior in this cluster did not change

significantly between the two periods. This might suggest that

their smartphone usage is not specifically oriented towards

studying. Morover, some users transitioned between clusters

from study to non-study periods, this shift could imply a change

in app usage behavior that may not necessarily align with

studying. For example, a shift from a balanced use of

communication and entertainment apps to more social and

media-focused apps may indicate a move away from study-

related activities.

***Cluster 0:*** This cluster predominantly engaged with Chat,

Social, and Media apps, indicating a balanced use of

communication and entertainment resources.

***Cluster 1:*** Users in this cluster showed a notable preference for

Finance apps, along with substantial use of Chat, and

Productivity apps, suggesting a focus on financial and

productive activities.

***Cluster 2:*** Marked by an exceptional engagement with Health &

Fitness apps, supplemented by Chat and Social apps, this

cluster's behavior points towards a health and wellness-oriented

digital footprint.

***Cluster 3:*** This group primarily utilized Chat, Social, and

Productivity apps, aligning with a focus on communication and

task-oriented activities.

***App usage patterns during non-study period***

The use of Chat and Social apps during study periods doesn't

conclusively indicate that students are not studying. These apps

could be used for study-related communication or brief breaks.

However, a high engagement in entertainment-oriented apps like

Media and Games might suggest non-study activities.

While the data shows that students are using smartphones during

the period they claim to be studying, it does not conclusively

indicate whether they are studying or not. The diverse usage of

apps, including both productivity and entertainment-oriented

apps, suggests a mixed pattern of smartphone usage. It's

plausible that students may be multitasking or alternating

between study and leisure activities. Therefore, a definitive

answer to the question requires more specific data on the intent

and context of smartphone usage during claimed study periods.

***Cluster 0:*** Maintained similar engagement patterns as observed

during the study period, with a primary focus on Chat and Social

apps.

***Cluster 1:*** Demonstrated a general decrease in app usage, with a

shift towards Chat, Social, and Media apps.

***Cluster 2:*** Consistently high engagement with Health & Fitness

apps continued, alongside Chat and Media apps.
